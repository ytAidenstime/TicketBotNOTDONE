# TicketBotNOTDONE
this is the ticket bot i coded its importent to understand this is one of the first real projects i have ever started and this is not the last one. i made this code in hopes of new people coming to the comunity and trying this bot out inside the code there is lots of things to read and guild you to setup this bot including all the tokens prefix and everything in the index.js file. its also importent to note that i have not even come close to finishing this and this is a beta thing also there will be a realese for this as a vip version with more features however that one will come at a cost prob about $5 for the code but its one time and is worth it. i am also totaly okey if you change this code as i hope you do this its gonna make it better as long as no credit is taken away from me im a ok with it!.
